# Exercise 2.10: Operators
# Create a ruby file called exercise-2.10.rb

# Create a class called calculator. Create four class methods: add, subtract, divide and multiply. Each method should have two parameters. Each method should do a basic level of an expression involving a certain operator and the given two parameters. For example, in the add method, you will use the + to evaluate the addition of both parameters. Execute each method to make sure they all work.
